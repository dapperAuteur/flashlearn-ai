## Implementation Approach

For each phase, we'll:
1. Create detailed GitHub issues with acceptance criteria
2. Implement features on feature-specific branches
3. Write comprehensive tests
4. Document the implementation in educational blog posts
5. Update the README with current status
6. Provide example API usage with curl commands
