## [INTRO - 0:00-0:10]

"Want to make studying more fun? FlashLearn's Versus Mode lets you challenge friends, classmates, or anyone to see who really knows the material. Here's how it works."

## [CREATE A CHALLENGE - 0:10-0:30]

*Navigate to Versus in the nav bar, click Create Challenge*

"From your dashboard, tap Versus in the navigation. Hit Create Challenge. Pick any flashcard set you want to compete on."

*Select a set, then choose study mode*

"Choose your study mode - classic or multiple choice. Then pick who can join: share a private code with friends, create a classroom challenge, or make it public for anyone to jump in. You can have up to 50 players in a single challenge."

## [SHARE THE CODE - 0:30-0:45]

*Show the challenge code modal after creation*

"Once your challenge is created, you'll get a unique code like VS-A3K9M2. Share it however you want - text it, post it, or drop it in your class chat. Anyone with the code can join."

*Click copy button, show sharing options*

## [PLAY THE CHALLENGE - 0:45-1:05]

*Show the challenge play screen with cards*

"When you're ready, hit Play. You'll study the exact same cards in the exact same order as everyone else - it's a level playing field."

*Answer a card, rate confidence*

"Answer each card and rate your confidence. Your score is based on four things: accuracy is worth the most at 40%, then speed at 25%, then how well your confidence matches your actual performance at 20%, and finally your longest streak of correct answers at 15%. The max score is 1000."

## [SEE RESULTS - 1:05-1:25]

*Show the results page with score comparison*

"After you finish, you'll see how you stack up against everyone else. You get a full breakdown - where you scored well, where you lost points."

*Show waiting state, then final results*

"If your opponent hasn't finished yet, you'll see a live status. Check the leaderboard to see how you rank globally, by set, or within your classroom."

*Navigate to leaderboard*

## [OUTRO - 1:25-1:35]

"Ready to compete? Create your first challenge now. It's the best way to make sure you actually know your stuff."
