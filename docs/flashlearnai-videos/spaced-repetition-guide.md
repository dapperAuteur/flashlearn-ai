# Video Script: How Spaced Repetition Works in FlashLearn AI

**Duration:** ~2 minutes

## [INTRO - 0:00-0:15]

*Show FlashLearn logo, then dashboard*

"Ever study something and forget it a week later? FlashLearn uses a technique called spaced repetition to fix that. It's backed by decades of cognitive science, and it's built right into the app. Let me show you how it works."

## [THE CONCEPT - 0:15-0:40]

*Optional: Show a simple "forgetting curve" diagram - a line that drops over time, then gets boosted by review*

"The idea is simple: you review information right before you're about to forget it. When you first learn something, you forget it fast - maybe within a day. But each time you successfully recall it, the memory gets stronger and lasts longer."

*Show intervals getting wider: 1 day, 6 days, 2 weeks, 1 month*

"So FlashLearn spaces out your reviews - first after one day, then six days, then two weeks, then a month, and so on. The better you know a card, the less often you see it."

## [HOW IT WORKS IN THE APP - 0:40-1:15]

*Show a study session - answering a card, then the confidence rating*

"Every time you study a card, FlashLearn asks you two things: did you get it right, and how confident were you?"

*Highlight the confidence rating scale 1-5*

"That confidence rating matters. If you got it right but weren't confident - a lucky guess - the app knows to show it to you sooner."

*Show an incorrect answer with high confidence*

"If you got it wrong but were confident, it resets the card so you can relearn it properly."

*Optional: Show a brief diagram of the SM-2 algorithm concept - not the math, just the flow*

"Behind the scenes, the app uses an algorithm called SM-2 to calculate exactly when each card should come back."

## [YOUR REVIEW SCHEDULE - 1:15-1:40]

*Navigate to the dashboard, point to the Review Schedule widget*

"On your dashboard, you'll see your Review Schedule. It shows how many cards are due today, tomorrow, and over the next two weeks."

*Expand the set breakdown, show the 14-day timeline*

"You can see which sets have the most cards coming up and jump straight into a review session."

*Click "Review Now" button*

"The key is consistency - even 5 minutes a day keeps your knowledge fresh. You'll also see your study streak, which tracks how many days in a row you've reviewed."

*Point to the streak stat on the dashboard*

## [THE RESULTS - 1:40-1:55]

*Navigate to the analytics page*

"Over time, you'll notice something: cards you know well almost disappear from your reviews. Cards you struggle with keep showing up until you truly learn them."

*Show accuracy trends chart, problem cards section*

"That's the magic - the system adapts to you. Check your analytics page to see your accuracy trends, problem cards, and how your confidence calibration improves over time."

## [OUTRO - 1:55-2:05]

*Show the dashboard with the Review Schedule*

"Start studying any set and your review schedule builds automatically. No setup needed. Just study, and FlashLearn handles the rest."
