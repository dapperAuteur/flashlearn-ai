I'd like to see analytics by flashcard set and by set category. allow users to sort/search analytics by set and by set category. allow admin to put flashcard sets into categories . allow users and admins to see analytics/metrics on individual flashcards (time, accuracy, confidence , accuracy vs confidence, front vs back, etc, multiple choice, ) and any other valuable metrics/analytics. create plan to implement.

let's get offline working properly. it should sync when back online and have a clear signal to user when offline

use ai to be a business consultant for the app to help with growth (social media, new features, new flashcards, marketing, review app analytics to recommend improvements, etc)
